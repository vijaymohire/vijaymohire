## üìú Legal & Compliance

**Intellectual Property & Patent Governance**

All Quantum AI (QAI) repositories and associated materials within **Bhadale IT Hub** are protected under structured intellectual property (IP) frameworks.  
This ensures clear traceability of invention disclosures, authorship, and jurisdictional ownership across India, the United States, and other partner nations.

**Core IP Policies**
- Every research upload includes a **Classification Header** and **Disclosure Record ID**.  
- All codebases are tagged for **open-source**, **restricted**, or **proprietary** usage.  
- Internal repositories (e.g., legal, compliance, and patent documentation) are kept private and version-controlled on GitLab.  
- Patent applications follow **PCT-first** or **national-first** filing routes as per project priority.  

**Filing & Compliance Frameworks**
- Managed under: `03_Legal_and_Compliance/IP_Filing_Programs`  
- Includes: Disclosure templates, jurisdiction filing workflows, NDA and IP protection procedures.  
- Aligns with: **ISO**, **NIST**, **TOGAF**, and international AI‚ÄìQuantum security guidelines.  
- Integrated into the **QAI Ops Framework** for audit-ready traceability.

> *Certain legal and technical repositories are intentionally private due to ongoing patent evaluation and confidentiality obligations.*

### ‚öñÔ∏è Global Jurisdiction and IP Expansion

- **Primary filings:** India (IPO), United States (USPTO), European Union (EPO).  
- **Future expansion:** BRICS, QUAD, and allied cooperative IP networks.  
- **Strategic Objective:** Secure defensible, multi-jurisdictional QAI patents with long-term commercial licensing potential.

---

### üîê Compliance & Confidentiality

- All collaborations operate under signed **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**.  
- Partner institutions and vendors must comply with **Post-Quantum Security** and **Responsible AI** mandates.  
- Access to private repositories or internal documentation requires **authorization through Bhadale IT Hub Legal Board**.
